# Dancoto Friends Visualizer

## Assumptions taken with design

- Input form will allow you to enter multiple friends one at a time
- The Friend field `friends` is numeric
- There would be some API saving, so simulated calls are done
- uuid is generated on UI to help mock recieving a unique ID from API
- Friend type is stored in the `types` project to simulate a shared type with other projects
